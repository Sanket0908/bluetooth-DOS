# Linux Bluetooth Scanning Troubleshooting Guide

## üî¥ Problem: Not Finding Devices on Linux

If the Linux version isn't finding devices but macOS is, here are the solutions:

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Commands (Run These First!)

Copy and paste these commands on your Chromebook/Linux:

```bash
# 1. Restart Bluetooth service
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

# 2. Power on the Bluetooth adapter
sudo hciconfig hci0 up

# 3. Enable scanning
sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan

# 4. Test with bluetoothctl
bluetoothctl power on
bluetoothctl scan on
# Wait 10 seconds, then:
bluetoothctl devices
bluetoothctl scan off
```

**Then try running the tool again:**
```bash
sudo python3 bluetooth_dos_linux.py
```

## üîç Why This Happens

### macOS vs Linux Difference:

| Feature | macOS (Bleak) | Linux (hcitool) |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| BLE Advertising | ‚úÖ Finds devices | ‚ùå Limited |
| Discoverable mode | Not required | **REQUIRED** |
| Scan method | High-level API | Raw HCI |
| Permissions | User-level | Needs root |

**Key Issue:** `hcitool` only finds devices in **discoverable/pairing mode**, while macOS/Bleak finds devices that are just advertising (like your CMF Buds when not in pairing mode).

---

## üéØ Solution: Put Devices in Discoverable Mode

### For Bluetooth Speakers:
1. **Turn on the speaker**
2. **Press and HOLD the Bluetooth button** (usually 3-5 seconds)
3. **Wait for blinking light** (indicates pairing/discoverable mode)
4. **NOW scan** with the tool

### For CMF Buds/Earbuds:
1. **Put buds in charging case**
2. **Press and hold the button on case** (5 seconds)
3. **Light should blink** (pairing mode)
4. **NOW scan** with the tool

### For Phones:
1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Bluetooth**
2. **Make sure Bluetooth is ON**
3. **Stay on the Bluetooth settings page** (makes it discoverable)
4. **NOW scan** with the tool

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Check Bluetooth Adapter

```bash
# Check if adapter exists
hciconfig

# Expected output:
# hci0:	Type: Primary  Bus: USB
# 	BD Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  ACL MTU: 1021:8  SCO MTU: 64:1
# 	UP RUNNING
```

**If you see "DOWN":**
```bash
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```

**If "hci0" doesn't exist:**
```bash
# Check USB Bluetooth
lsusb | grep -i bluetooth

# Check Bluetooth service
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
```

---

### Step 2: Test Bluetooth Service

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status bluetooth

# If not running:
sudo systemctl start bluetooth

# Enable on boot
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
```

---

### Step 3: Manual Scan Test

Try manual scanning to see if it's a tool issue or system issue:

```bash
# Test 1: bluetoothctl (modern, works best)
bluetoothctl
# Inside bluetoothctl:
power on
scan on
# Wait 10 seconds
devices
scan off
exit

# Test 2: hcitool classic scan
sudo hcitool scan

# Test 3: BLE scan (deprecated but sometimes works)
sudo timeout 8 hcitool lescan
```

**If these don't find devices either:**
- Your devices aren't in discoverable mode
- Bluetooth adapter issue
- Interference/range issue

**If these DO find devices:**
- The tool has a bug (use improved version)

---

### Step 4: Check Permissions

```bash
# Make sure you're running with sudo
sudo python3 bluetooth_dos_linux.py

# Check your user is in bluetooth group
groups | grep bluetooth

# If not, add yourself:
sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth $USER
# Then log out and log back in
```

## üöÄ Updated Tool (Better Scanning)

I've updated `bluetooth_dos_linux.py` with improved scanning that:
- ‚úÖ Uses `bluetoothctl` (more reliable)
- ‚úÖ Automatically powers on adapter
- ‚úÖ Falls back to `hcitool` if needed
- ‚úÖ Shows troubleshooting tips if no devices found

**Transfer the updated file to your Chromebook and try again!**

---

## üìä Comparison: What Each Method Finds

### bluetoothctl (BEST):
```bash
bluetoothctl scan on
```
‚úÖ Finds BLE devices advertising  
‚úÖ Finds Classic Bluetooth in discoverable mode  
‚úÖ Modern and maintained  
‚úÖ Works on most Linux systems  

### hcitool scan (LIMITED):
```bash
sudo hcitool scan
```
‚úÖ Finds Classic Bluetooth in discoverable mode  
‚ùå Doesn't find BLE devices  
‚ùå Deprecated  
‚ö†Ô∏è Only works if device is actively discoverable  

### hcitool lescan (DEPRECATED):
```bash
sudo hcitool lescan
```
‚úÖ Finds some BLE devices  
‚ùå Deprecated, may not work  
‚ùå Requires root  
‚ö†Ô∏è Unreliable

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### Before Running the Tool:

1. **Prepare your test device (speaker/earbuds):**
   - Turn it on
   - Put in **PAIRING MODE** (blinking light)
   - Keep it close (2-3 meters)

2. **Prepare Linux/Chromebook:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
   sudo hciconfig hci0 up
   ```

3. **Run the updated tool:**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 bluetooth_dos_linux.py
   ```

4. **Select option 1** (Scan)

5. **Wait for scan to complete**

6. **You should now see your device!**

## üîß Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "hci0: No such device"
```bash
# Check if Bluetooth hardware exists
lsusb | grep -i bluetooth
rfkill list bluetooth

# If blocked:
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
```

### Issue: "Operation not permitted"
```bash
# Always use sudo
sudo python3 bluetooth_dos_linux.py
```

### Issue: Finds devices but can't attack
```bash
# Some devices have DOS protection
# Try different devices
# Make sure device is close enough
```

### Issue: "bluetoothctl: command not found"
```bash
# Install BlueZ
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bluez bluetooth
```

## üéì For Chromebook Specifically

### Chromebook-Specific Issues:

1. **Linux container might not have Bluetooth access**
   
   Fix:
   ```bash
   # Check if Bluetooth is available in container
   ls /dev/hci*
   
   # If not, you may need to enable it in Chromebook settings
   # Settings ‚Üí Linux ‚Üí Develop Android apps ‚Üí Enable Bluetooth
   ```

2. **Bluetooth might be controlled by Chrome OS**
   
   Workaround:
   - Make sure Chrome OS Bluetooth is ON
   - Disconnect any connected devices in Chrome OS
   - Then use Linux tools

3. **Permissions in container**
   
   ```bash
   # Run with sudo (always)
   sudo python3 bluetooth_dos_linux.py
   ```

## üé¨ Demo-Ready Checklist

To ensure devices are found during your presentation:

- [ ] Speaker is in **PAIRING MODE** (blinking light)
- [ ] Speaker is **CLOSE** (within 3 meters)
- [ ] Chrome OS Bluetooth is **ON**
- [ ] Linux Bluetooth service is **RUNNING**
- [ ] Adapter is **POWERED ON** (`hciconfig hci0 up`)
- [ ] Running tool with **SUDO**
- [ ] Using **UPDATED** version of the tool
- [ ] Tested before presentation!

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test the night before your presentation**
   - Don't wait until the last minute
   - Make sure scanning works reliably

2. **Have a backup plan**
   - Record a video of it working
   - Show that as backup if live demo fails

3. **Use a cheap Bluetooth speaker**
   - More reliable than earbuds for demos
   - Bigger buttons, easier to put in pairing mode
   - Visual indicator (blinking light)

4. **Scan multiple times**
   - First scan might not find everything
   - Let it run for 15-20 seconds

5. **Keep device close**
   - 2-3 meters max during demo
   - Reduces interference issues

## üî¨ Debug Script

Run this to diagnose your setup:

```bash
# Save this as bluetooth_debug.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Bluetooth Diagnostic ==="
echo ""

echo "1. Bluetooth Service:"
sudo systemctl status bluetooth | grep Active

echo ""
echo "2. Bluetooth Adapter:"
hciconfig

echo ""
echo "3. RF Kill Status:"
rfkill list bluetooth

echo ""
echo "4. Bluetooth Tools:"
which bluetoothctl
which hcitool

echo ""
echo "5. Quick Scan Test:"
timeout 5 sudo hcitool scan

echo ""
echo "=== End Diagnostic ==="
```

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist

If you've done all this and still no devices:

1. ‚úÖ Bluetooth service running?
2. ‚úÖ Adapter powered on?
3. ‚úÖ Using sudo?
4. ‚úÖ Target device in pairing mode?
5. ‚úÖ Target device close enough?
6. ‚úÖ Using updated scanning code?
7. ‚úÖ Manual `bluetoothctl` scan works?

If all YES but still no devices in tool:
- Try the manual `bluetoothctl` commands
- Copy the MAC addresses manually
- Or use the improved version I created

---

**Bottom Line:** The main issue is devices need to be in **DISCOVERABLE/PAIRING MODE** on Linux, unlike macOS which can find devices just advertising. Put your speaker in pairing mode and it will work!
